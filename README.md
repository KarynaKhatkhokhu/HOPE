# HOPE: a compact tool inspired by DBT skills

That will hopefully be usefull to you.

This application is a tool inspired by DBT, meant to be easily accessible. To actually learn how to use such skills, we recommend referring to Marsha M. Linehan's DBT Handouts.

If your distress is higher than 6 on the distress scale (0 being minimum, and 10 being maximum), reach out for help to your nearest emergency services or contact your therapist.
